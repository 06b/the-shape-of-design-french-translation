## RATIONALE ##

The English term ‘Design’ [is often used AS IS in French][DESIGN],
but the connotations are different: industrial design is
strongly implied, and so is the translation ‘conception’
suggested by the [GDT][CONCEPTION].

[CONCEPTION]: http://gdt.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=8365304

On the other hand, translating only ‘Graphic Design’
as ‘graphisme’, or ‘arts graphiques’ would be too
restrictive, reducing the larger scope of the book.

I thus settled for ‘création’, which is often used in the
context of ‘création artistique’, graphic design and design
in general. It comes with a religious/sacred connotation,
which is not out of a place here, and resonates with the
radiating illustration of the front cover.
