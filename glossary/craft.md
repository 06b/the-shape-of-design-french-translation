# Craft #

Technique

## Rationale ##

The noun 'craft' corresponds to three different words in French:

  * art
  * métier
  * artisanat

There is no direct equivalent to the verb 'to craft', which requires
a whole locution and cannot be expressed without a complement in French:
'faire (quelque chose) à la main'.

The first one, 'art', is the most general and well adapted in the
context of this book: it covers the whole range from the best practice
to fine arts, and carries broad, positive values of creativity and quality.

The second word, 'métier', would be an appropriate translation in some
contexts, when the skill is applied to a professional undertaking. This
is also the common word for job or profession, and as such, it carries a lot
of associated meanings which tend to restrict its use to professional
activities that you are licensed to do by diploma or by trade. It sounds
strange and feels out of place in the context of this book.

The third word, 'artisanat', is limited to handiwork. It excludes work done
with a computer, which is too restrictive for this book.

In French, the cursor between arts & crafts lies more to the right in the
equivalent expression arts & métiers: the lexical scope of 'arts' is much
broader than the scope of 'métiers', more limited with regards to 'crafts'.

This makes 'art' (fr) a good fit for 'craft' (en). However, 'art' fails to
put enough emphasis on the manual aspect of the craft.

I later explored a different direction, following a mention of
[“five very important Aristotelian concepts”]
(http://www.psychsoma.co.za/learning_in_vivo/2009/09/techne-episteme-poiesis-praxis.html)
by Dr Thomas Groenewald, quoting Charles Sides and Ann Mrvica:

  * [Techne (τέχνη)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne)
  * [Episteme (ἐπιστήμη)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme)
  * [Poiesis (ποίησις)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poiesis)
  * [Praxis (πρᾶξις)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process))
  * [Phronesis (φρόνησις)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis)

These five concepts are all related to transformation and creation:

  * Techne (τέχνη) is the closest to craft: making concrete things by hand,
    it is both art and craft. The word 'technique' (en/fr) derives from τέχνη.
  * Episteme (ἐπιστήμη) is the knowledge behind the craft, the knowledge of
    theoretical forms and how to turn them into concrete forms; again, it
    is both art and craft, but in a more abstract way. The word 'epistemology'
    derives from ἐπιστήμη.
  * Poiesis (ποίησις) is like the active form of 'craft'; like craft, it is
    first a verb (ποιέω): 'to make'. Poiesis is more interested in the creation
    of life than material things, however, in creating a movement which changes
    a thing into another, taking part in the continuous creation of the world.
    The word 'poetry' originates from the greek concept of 'Poiesis'.
  * Praxis (πρᾶξις) is a cycle of application of ideas, assessment, and
    refinement of the reflection. This is a process of transformation of
    ideas through their application. The word 'practice' derives from 'Praxis'.
  * Phronesis (φρόνησις) is the wisdom or virtue behind Praxis; this is the
    transformation of oneself through improvement of our moral understanding.

While these five words evoke different aspects of creation described in
“The Shape of Design”, τέχνη has the strongest affinity with craft. And thus,
I eventually settled for the derived word 'technique', which trades some of
the highbrow sophistication of 'art' for down-to-earth manipulation with
a hint of dexterity and a wisp of technology.

The article [Connaissance technique]
(https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connaissance_technique), in French Wikipedia,
illustrates the broad lexical word of the word 'technique'.
