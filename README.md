“The Shape of Design” book by Frank Chimero,
French translation by Eric Bréchemier.

## BACK STORY ##

I discovered the book project during its crowdfunding process
on [Kickstarter]
(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fchimero/the-shape-of-design).

I backed the project after watching
[this video of a presentation by Frank Chimero]
(http://vimeo.com/17084347), also entitled “The Shape of Design”,
which had set my expectations really high.

Truth be told, I was disappointed by the book at first, which
was nothing like the Graphic Design books that I had read so far.
But I was deeply touched by the message, the story and the storytelling.
And now that I have resolved to share it with my English-impaired fellow
French, I appreciate the true value of its brevity.
