## BACK STORY ##

I discovered the book project during its crowdfunding process
on [Kickstarter]
(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fchimero/the-shape-of-design).

I backed the project after watching
[this video of a presentation by Frank Chimero]
(http://vimeo.com/17084347), also entitled “The Shape of Design”,
which had set my expectations really high.

Truth be told, I was disappointed by the book at first, which
was nothing like the Graphic Design books that I had read so far.
But I was deeply touched by the message, the story and the storytelling.
And now that I have resolved to share it with my English-impaired fellow
French, I appreciate the true value of its brevity.

Still, translating this book is no meager task. Each sentence has been
carefully crafted, weighted and chiseled to resonate on multiple levels,
which makes the work of the translator all the more challenging and rewarding.
